For this Lab, I tried to create a carousel that contained
the news articles as well as a button to them so that the user can 
be redirected to the article. I wanted the carousel to switch every 5 seconds or so
so the users coudl glance at the titles, and if there is one that goes by and caught their
eye, there are left and right conrtol on the carousel so they can return to a previous
page (as well as go to the next one). One thin that I really tried to focus on in this lab was
the use of bootstrap. I never really used bootstrap in my lab last 
semester, and neither did any of my groupmates, so it was interesting to earn how it works and how the styling
is different from that of regular html/css. I used this youtube tutorial to get me started on
learning bootstrap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eow125xV5-c 
One htin I tried to focus on which was specified in our instructions was how to make it so that the
page stays in tact when the screen is resized- I know e are going to be workin a lot with that on
future labs, so I tried using things like col-sm-4 to properly size them.
The carousel template that I used was oriinally on the W3Schools basic carousel tutorial,
but theirs only showed pictures running through it so I took the basic format of each of the inner carousel items and
changed each of the slides to add some of the things I had learned in my bootstrap tutorial.
One thing that I really struggled with on this lab was getting my json to read in correctly. I spent hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong,
and I tried to rewrite my javascript functions so many times to get the right information to ouptput, but I could not seem 
to get it no matter what I tried. I included a news.js file in my lab which contains all of the js that I wrote that should in theory 
add more slides to the carousel with the json data that I collected when the html document loads. the basic logic
of it was in my column 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 sections of the news.json file there are exactly 20 news articles. I wanted one article from
each column to populate the page at a time, so I tried to pull the title and link and put them in variables.
Then I used the inner carousel id and tried to append on all of the html that included the titles and links of five articles
that would al be displayed and formatted with bootstrap. I commented out some of the other ideas that I had worked with,
and I have a carousel.html page where I also tried a couple other things, which I will include as well so you can see a rough draft of some of the other work.
But, my main work is in the news.html file. I did actually start this lab 5 days before it was due,
but despite that I was unable to fully et the json part- so, I have spoken with one of my friends who is also an IT major and I am going to
get together with them this weekend so they can help me sort out where I am oing wrong with the json so I do not run into this problem on another lab.
If I still feel like I don't have a better grasp on json after this weekend I will reach out or come to office hours. I have also been in 
isolation without a roommate for ten days because of covid- so that probably didnt help my productivity lately either.
