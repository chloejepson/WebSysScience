Chloe Jepson readme lab 3
for the frontend of this lab, I wanted to make the experience esily readable for
the user, as well as fitting to the theme of pokemon. that is why i chose to do the sections that were
split by lines, and each had bootstrap styling- to fit the theme like a pokedex. in the background 
there mare moving clouds which I pulled off of some source code online
here are some links i used to help me do those things: https://usejquery.com/css/cloud-background-animation-using-css-svg/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xrZtTf_bB0
to import an api, I chose to use the pokemon AP, because it has a lot more than 10 data values for
each pokemon, but it also had a lot of other areas of the game that it offers information for. All of the pictures and 
information that is being refreshed onto the screen is coming from the pokemon api. In designin my oown api, I ran into 
trouble, because I did not know how to use the external API toether with my API. The post method of my api works well,
and I used the get method to direct the user to the homepage when localhost:3000 is first opened, but I could not figure out how to 
do the pu and delete options. I tried for a lon time to browse all ofver the internet and watch tutorials, but I never fully understood how I could implement something like 
a delete method when there was no database. I know that lab states this, but it really threw me off in the lab, because it felt like there was an objective that we were
unable to complete. the post method that I created allows the user to submit a name of a pokemon and a location to report that they found it at 
a specific area. It prints out to loalhost:3000 when printed, as well as in the console for you to see. I left some of my code that I had otten stuck on 
commented out under the server.js file so it would be more aparrent which parts I ot stuck on. For this lab, the main creativity was supposed to be the use of bootstrap and css 
to look like a pokedex, as well as creating an application that would allow the user to interact so much with storing different data and 
uploading it in a different way in the forms for each kind of request.
here are some of the main sources that i used for this assignment:
